*   Class BridgePort is a "port" on a Bridge. A "port" is an interface pointing to an ISS Service Access Point.
*      The ISS SAP can be provided, for example, by a Mac or by an Aggregator in a LinkAgg shim.
*   For the purposes of testing Link Aggregation the BridgePort needs very little functionality, however the
*      structure allows the addition of more fields and methods as the Bridge functionality gets more fully developed.
