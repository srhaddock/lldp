/*
*   The structure of a Frame in this simulation is a Frame header that includes a pointer to the first Sdu in a chain
*       of one or more Sdus.  The final Sdu in the chain has a nullptr for the pointer to the next Sdu.
*   The Frame header includes the parameters of ISS/EISS request/indication service primitives described in IEEE Std 802.1AC
*       and IEEE 802.1Q.  These parameters include the destination MAC address, source MAC address, VLAN_identifier, priority,
*       drop_eligible, etc. 
*   The Sdu base class includes an EtherType and a SubType (which is zero for EtherTypes that don't support sub types) to identify
*       the derived class.  Derived classes add parameters specific to the derived type (e.g. VLAN tag, LACPDU, DRCPDU, ...).
*       There is no difference between a "tag", a "Protocol Data Unit (PDU)", and a "Service Data Unit (SDU)" as far as this
*       simulation is concerned.
*   A Frame object is instantiated using "std::make_unique<Frame>" and is accessed via a "std::unique_ptr<Frame>" (or a reference).
*       An object of a class derived from Sdu is created using, for example, "std::make_shared<Lacpdu>" and is accessed via a 
*       a "std::shared_ptr<Lacpdu>" or "std::shared_ptr<Sdu>" (or a reference). This means there is a single "owner" of any Frame,
*       and that Frame can be modified by inserting or removing "tags" without affecting other Frames in the simulation.  When a 
*       Frame is replicated (for example within a Bridge), a "shallow" copy is made.  This means the pointer to the Sdu in the 
*       Frame header is copied, but the Sdu itself is not copied.  It is therefore critical that Sdus are not modified once they
*       created, or it could result in unintentional changes to other Frames elsewhere in the simultated network.
*   Frames propagate through the simulated network by moving the unique pointer using the "transmit()" method of the Mac
*       (to move between Devices), and the "indicate()" and "request()" methods of classes derived from the Iss base class 
*       (to move between Components within a Device).
